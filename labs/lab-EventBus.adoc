== Summary

We are going to persist the insults retrieved by our application.  To do this we will add a Verticle, DbVerticle, to handle our database operations.

The InsultGatewayVerticle will call DbVerticle by sending and receiving messages over Vert.x Event Bus.  We will use a single messaging endpoint and send different instructions for persisting and retrieving insults.

== KeyTerms in this Step

* Vert.x EventBus
* Addresses
* Handlers

=== Vert.x Event Bus

The Vert.x event bus is part of Vert.x core.  The event bus is the nervous system of Vert.x.  There is a single event bus instance for every Vert.x instance and it is obtained using the method eventBus.  The event bus allows different parts of your application to communicate with each other irrespective of what language they are written in, and whether they’re in the same Vert.x instance, or in a different Vert.x instance.  It can even be bridged to allow client side JavaScript running in a browser to communicate on the same event bus.

The event bus forms a distributed peer-to-peer messaging system spanning multiple server nodes and multiple browsers.  The event bus supports publish/subscribe, point to point, and request-response messaging.

The event bus API is very simple. It basically involves registering handlers, unregistering handlers and sending and publishing messages.

It is a particulary good choice for separating functionality such as persistence.

==== Addressing
Messages are sent on the event bus to an address.

Vert.x doesn’t bother with any fancy addressing schemes. In Vert.x an address is simply a string. Any string is valid. However it is wise to use some kind of scheme, e.g. using periods to demarcate a namespace.

Some examples of valid addresses are europe.news.feed1, acme.games.pacman, sausages, and X.

==== Handlers
Messages are received in handlers. You register a handler at an address.

Many different handlers can be registered at the same address.  A single handler can be registered at many different addresses.

== Step 1: Fail a test

Create a new package for our database classes, "io.vertx.starter.database," and add a new UnitTest in the package, "DbVerticleTest."  Be sure to annotate it with the VertxUnitRunner, create a Vertx member variable, and "setUp" and "tearDown" methods:

[code,java]
....

package io.vertx.starter.database;

import io.vertx.core.Vertx;
import io.vertx.ext.unit.TestContext;
import io.vertx.ext.unit.junit.VertxUnitRunner;
import org.junit.After;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

@RunWith(VertxUnitRunner.class)     <1>
public class DbVerticleTest {

  private Vertx vertx;     <2>

  @Before
  public void setUp(TestContext testContext) {     <3>
    vertx = Vertx.vertx();
    vertx.deployVerticle(DbVerticle.class.getName(), testContext.asyncAssertSuccess());     <4>
  }

  @After
  public void tearDown(TestContext testContext){     <5>
    vertx.close(testContext.asyncAssertSuccess());     <6>
  }

....
<1> The VertxUnitRunner is needed for fine grained control of the asynchronous calls in the UnitTest.  In the default JUnit lifecycle of before/test/after the test method is executed even if there are pending Async objects in the before method. The runner gives this necessary fine grained control and delays events until the asynchronous calls have finished
<2> Each test has a private Vertx instance
<3> The TestContext class provides numerous useful methods for asynchronous testing.  It isn't required, but it makes testing much easier
<4> We deploy our new (yet to be created) Verticle and check for a successful deployment asynchronously
<5> The tearDown method is familiar to JUnit users.  It also gets a TestContext
<6> Clean up our running Vertx instance


[code,java]
....

  @Test
  public void testPersistInsult(TestContext testContext) {

    Async async = testContext.async();     <1>

    JsonObject message = new JsonObject()     <2>
      .put("action", "persist")
      .put("insult", "Congrats, spongy strumpet!");

    vertx.eventBus().send(INSULTS_ADDRESS, message, ar -> {     <3>
      assertTrue(ar.succeeded());     <4>
      JsonObject result = (JsonObject) ar.result().body();     <5>
      testContext.assertEquals("success", result.getString("outcome"));     <6>
      async.complete();     <7>
    });

  }

....

<1> Create an Async Object so that our test doesn't exit when the action passes to another thread (our event bus)
<2> Create the message payload to send over the event bus.  Json is the recommended format both because it is easy to work with and because it is cross language.  The event bus is an easy way to communicate with other languages, especially front-end JavaScript
<3> This line does 3 things:
* calls the eventBus() method of our Vertx object on the specified address, "INSULTS_ADDRESS"
* passes our newly created message
* handles the response
<4> We assume success
<5> Get the JsonObject from the returned message
<6> We verify the returned message
<7> Wrap up the test by telling the TestContext that is safe to exit

Run the test to verify that it doesn't work.  The test shouldn't even compile at this point because it references a non-existant DbVerticle.

Let's create the DbVerticle so that we can fail the test.

[code,java]
....

package io.vertx.starter.database;

import io.vertx.core.AbstractVerticle;
import io.vertx.core.Future;
import io.vertx.core.eventbus.EventBus;
import io.vertx.core.eventbus.Message;
import io.vertx.core.eventbus.MessageConsumer;
import io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject;

public class DbVerticle extends AbstractVerticle {


  public static final String INSULTS_ADDRESS = "insults-address";     <1>

  @Override
  public void start(Future<Void> future) {

    EventBus eventBus = vertx.eventBus();     <2>

    MessageConsumer<JsonObject> consumer = eventBus.consumer(INSULTS_ADDRESS);     <3>
    consumer.handler(message -> {     <4>

      String action = message.body().getString("action");     <5>

      switch (action) {      <6>
        case "persist":
          persistInsult(message);
          break;
        case "retrieve":
          retrieveInsults(message);
          break;
        default:
          message.fail(1, "Unkown action: " + message.body());     <7>
      }
    });

    future.complete();

  }

  private void persistInsult(Message<JsonObject> message) {
    message.reply(new JsonObject().put("outcome", "failure"));     <8>
  }

  private void retrieveInsults(Message<JsonObject> message) {
    message.reply(new JsonObject().put("outcome", "failure"));
  }
}

....

<1> We will use a publicly available constant for our address.  Addresses are just Strings, and Constants prevent typos.  I hate debugging typos
<2> We get the EventBus from our vertx member variable 
<3> We create a MessageConsumer on the address
<4> We attach a Handler to handle the incoming messages
<5> We get the specified "action" from our message
<6> We are only implementing one handler that will check the action and then call the appropriate method
<7> If the action is unspecified we will return an error.  Vert.x EventBus requires a numerical error code and a message.  We will have a better implementation of this shortly
<8> Both of our methods simply fail at the moment (red, green, refactor)

Run the test to make sure it fails (you don't want phantom successes!):

[code,bash]
....

mvn clean test

....

The test should fail with my favorite failure message of this entire lab:

[code,bash]
....

java.lang.AssertionError: Not equals : success != failure

....

If for some reason it passes raise your hand and ask one of the guys who looks like they know what they are doing for help.

== Step 2: Pass the test

Now that we have failed a test it's time to make it pass.  We could of course simply change the "outcome" to "success," but that would be cheating.  We have a lot of work to do to make it pass.  Enough work that it is in the next lab on databases.  If you want to cheat you change the "outcome" to "success."
